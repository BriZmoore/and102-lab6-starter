Android Project 6 - Campground Explorer Pt. 3: Fragments and Navigation

Submitted by: Brianna Moore

Campground Explorer Pt. 3 is the final stage of the Campground Explorer application. This project brings together the functionality of both the Parks App (Unit 3) and the Campground Explorer App (Unit 4), combining them into a single application that allows users to seamlessly browse National Parks and Campgrounds using Bottom Navigation and Fragments.
Users can switch between tabs to view a list of parks or a list of campgrounds, each displayed in its own fragment. Tapping on an item navigates to a detail screen with more information, including descriptions, photos, and coordinates.

Time spent: 2 hours
